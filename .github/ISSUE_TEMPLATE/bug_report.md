**Prerequisites**

* [ ] Are you running the latest version of the plugin? (Check [releases](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/releases))
* [ ] Are you running a supported version of Gradle? (Check the [README](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/blob/master/README.md))
* [ ] Are you running a supported version of Apache Avro? (Check the [README](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/blob/master/README.md))
* [ ] Are you running a supported version of Java? (Check the [README](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/blob/master/README.md))
* [ ] Did you check to see if an [issue](https://github.com/davidmc24/gradle-avro-plugin/issues) has already been submitted?
* [ ] Are you reporting to the correct repository?  If your schema doesn't work with the Apache Avro CLI tool either, it's not a problem with this plugin.  Running your file through the `CLIComparisonTest` in the sample project under the `test-project` directory can help diagnose this.
* [ ] Did you perform a cursory search?
